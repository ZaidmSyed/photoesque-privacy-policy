        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Photoesque ("we," "our," or "us"). Photoesque is an iOS application developed by Zenith Labs that uses AI-powered photo analysis to help users select the best photo from a group. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access or use the application.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Photos</h3>
        <p>
            When you use Photoesque, you may select photos from your device library for analysis. These photos are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporarily converted to base64 format for transmission</li>
            <li>Sent to our secure backend server (hosted on Railway) via encrypted HTTPS connection</li>
            <li>Forwarded to OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision API for AI-powered quality analysis</li>
            <li><strong>NOT stored on our servers</strong> after analysis is complete</li>
            <li><strong>NOT stored on OpenAI's servers</strong> after processing (per OpenAI's API terms)</li>
            <li>Processed in real-time and immediately discarded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Analysis results (quality scores) are temporarily stored only in your device's memory and are not transmitted or stored elsewhere.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Subscription Data</h3>
        <p>
            Photoesque offers a subscription service priced at $1.99 per week with a 3-day free trial. Subscription management is handled through:

        </ul>
        <p>
